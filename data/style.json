Intricate details in costumes, architecture, and magical effects. Expressive faces with emotional depth. Oil painting meets digital art aesthetic.",

  "dialogue_rendering": {
    "instruction": "Include speech bubbles with dialogue text clearly readable. Bubbles should have a slightly rough, hand-drawn quality that fits the painterly style. Position bubbles to not obscure important visual elements. Use parchment-tinted bubbles for narration, white for speech, jagged for shouting, wispy for whispers or magical speech."
