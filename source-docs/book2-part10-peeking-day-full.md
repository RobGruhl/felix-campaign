▪
A Traveler’s Guide to Larithia
▪
The book is written by a scholar from a city called Myon-Thalas, who
made many expeditions to Larithia, a beautiful city that rose out of a crater
far to the south. Chains held down floating islands with palaces where
philosophers and learned people could study the universe in peace. It was
written during the reign of Ilrune the Dreamer-King, seventh of his name.
▪
The writer describes being intimidated by the endless knowledge of
Larithia, witnessing magic spells she had never seen and wondrous
devices that could harness fire and thunder. She was invited to a sky
palace where she discussed deep concepts with high scholars and drank
disgusting white tea from a stone bowl. The high scholars knew
impossible things about life and reality.
▪
There is a very long section about restaurants.
▪
The writer spent some time in The Glass Citadel, a shiny resort with bars,
casinos, and a generally more laid-back vibe. It was a very new addition to
the kingdom, at that time under the rule of its first lord, called the “glass
authority.”
▪
The book ends with a summary of the author’s thoughts, that the city of
Larithia is an enchanting place, but to beware the feeling of insignificance
that comes after being around that kind of knowledge and zeal.

legend it was based on and learns about the land and the four dwarven kings.

one who brought Nun to Soapstone, she was compelled by the orb to do so.
