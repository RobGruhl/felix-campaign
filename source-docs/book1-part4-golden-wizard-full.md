# Book 1, Part 4: Full Text (Chapters 28-36)

Chapter 28: A Most Welcome Rest
o
Upon leaving the tomb/house Viz passes out into a coma.
o
The party leaves them in a kind gnome’s house. His name is Richard, and he has
four kids, so the party paid him handsomely.
o
Eurostras plays a pirate tune, Corpium blows glass and tries to revolutionize the
rowdiest child (in a good way). Eurostras is gifted with an acorn (he will cherish it
forever).
o
The party is woken up to the smell of delicious cinnamon rolls and leaves Viz a
note stating that they are headed to Coal Burg and a copy of the map. Eurostras
draws a mustache on their face and Corpium attempts to scam 40 gp from them.
They set off for the outpost town via the gnome forest.
-
Chapter 29: Charm Person
o
Upon wandering through the forest, the party notices that they started to get really
depressed in some shady spots (dafuq??)
o
Shortly thereafter, the party comes across Johnny Snakeyes, an acolyte of
Rizzmodeus, who wishes to rizz the dragon. The party gawks at his beauty.
o
The party tries “the library” test with him but fails since Johnny does not know
what that is.
o
Armando and Johnny get into a rizz-off in which they attempt to “charm person”
the other. Armando is charmed and loses. The party asks Johnny to join up with
them so they can all go “rizz the dragon.”
o
The party makes it out of the forest and into the war-torn plains.
-
Chapter 30: Subjects of the Leech Lord
o
Upon entering the plains, the party is jumped by a gang of leech covered goblins.
o
Eurostras gets properly fucked up (within an inch of his life).
o
Corpium gets some sick ass kills.
o
Armando makes a goblin explode coating Eurostras in blood (twice).
o
Eurostras communicates via primordial to one of the goblins and learns of the
leech lord, a powerful leech god living under the melted castle.
o
The party captures the goblin and heads to the outpost town.
-
Chapter 31: War Camp
o
The party is stopped by some soldiers of Godrick the Golden who explain the war
effort and attempt to recruit the party to fight against Mimeoplasm and its army of
monsters as well as their treaty with the goblins. The underground path is blocked
by the leech lord and the giant.
o
The party gracefully rejects the offer and asks if they can chill in the camp for a
bit. The guards say yes and have the party followed by their intern Josh.
o
After wandering around a bit, they spot a tent guarded by lots of knights.
Eurostras asks if Godrick the Golden is inside, and Josh says it would be treason
to answer that (so, yes).
o
The party tries to smooth talk their way in, but Armando just says, “fuck it” and
uses a teleportation bead to get inside.
o
Eurostras follows while Corpium waits outside.
-
Chapter 32: Talk to the Wizard
o
The guards point their weapons at Armando trying to figure out who he is and
what he wants.
o
Armando tries to lie and say he was testing his teleportation magic (it fails).
o
Eurostras makes eye contact from behind the guards with Godrick and the
situation de-escalates on account of Godrick recognizing the party (minus one
Whortheus).
o
The party tries to get information out of Gorick without revealing too much of
what they know. Corpium comes in as well.
o
Godrick is able to control Corpium with the staff.
o
Eventually they realize Godrick seems like a trustworthy fellow and give more
information.
o
They learn he is trying to tame/control a dragon in order to aid the war effort.
Controlling a dragon with Silneas’ staff requires control of the mind and the body
(neat).
o
The party gets limited information on the Mountain of truth and the Waterdeep
Project and decides to head out.
o
Godrick reveals his plans to re-conquer the magic city in the name of his rule and
defeat the monsters. He also mentions that the underground path is blocked by the
leech lord and that Aquarius the hidden was sent through the tunnel during the
WDP.
-
Chapter 33: FATHEEERRR?
o
As they are about to leave a Clown by the name of Flibbidy tries to breach into
the war tent and is stopped by the guards. He claims to have visions of his true
self from the Clown Messiah and says he needs to get into the tent.
o
He is met with agreement from the party minus Armando (he fucking hates
clowns), but is eventually let in.
o
Upon entering, Godrick is shocked to recognize the clown as his father.
o
The party uses the ring of truth to communicate with the brainwashed clown and
learn details of the Waterdeep project.
o
After some puzzled remarks, the party starts to piece together the information
given to them and comes to the realization that the clowns they have met along
the way were the brainwashed wizards who went missing during the Waterdeep
Project.
o
They also learn Gimmel’s fourth personality, Nun, was created to store all the
magical knowledge taken from the Wizards at the WDP.
o
The Waterdeep project took place 5-6 years after Eurostras’ memory faded out
and 7 years before Armando’s vicious clown incident.
o
In losing the ring, “Him” comes back out with newfound feelings towards his
“existence” he has become more calm with it as it is like a serious state of
meditation/monk sleep. “Him” is also starting to feel like he is the second
personality and not the original.
o
Armando is starting to get confused as to where to place his hatred for Clowns as
he realizes the clowns that attacked him and the ones in Clown town may in fact
not be the same people. Despite the fact that they both worship the Clown
Messiah.
o
The leading theory is that Silneas is responsible behind the clown town
incident/WDP.
o
The party convinces the king/Flibbidy to recruit the other clowns and bring them
back here so they can have their memory restored by the waters of the fountain of
truth. As this conversation ensues, plans are made for the party to head north to
attempt to tame a dragon and continue on to the mountain of truth.
o
Godrick promises the party lord status if they can succeed with their mission.
o
Corpium is very excited by this.
o
As this conversation is happening the party tries to hint at “the library” and in
doing so, the bowl in Eurostras’ duffel bag begins to fill back up with water.
o
The party convinces Flibbidy to drink from the bowl and summon what they think
will be a librarian (it won’t be).
-
Chapter 34: DaHistorian Lamistorian
o
The bowl is finished and Flibbidy is blinded temporarily.
o
Instead of the usual librarian appearing, a far more terrifying entity known only as
a historian appears from the bowl and destroys the war tent.
o
The party and pretty much everyone around them, is utterly horrified.
o
It grabs Godrick and asks him for information on the royal crypts.
o
After some mental messaging, Godrick tells him, and the historian runs off
towards the magic city.
o
Godrick is left with the unwanted knowledge/curse of “the library.” The party
catches him up to speed and reveals the extent of their plans.
o
Eurostras leaves the bowl with Godrick.
o
The party finalizes their plans and heads off towards Coal Burg and eventually
Soapstone Cathedral.
-
Chapter 35: Why You Should Never Poke the Bear
o
The party sets off north, on the way through the mountains they are met with
another depression-inducing forest.
o
While walking through a cave, they are met with a battle-scarred and
lightning-damaged, giant bear.
o
The bear states that it sends a warning from the Leshy that the forest rejects the
party members.
o
This bear is clearly a manifestation of the pretty awful moment at the start of the
campaign that resulted in the deaths of Whortheus and a poked bear.
o
Eurostras and Armando apologize for the incident.
-
Chapter 36: The Gang Gets Religious
o
Shortly after, the party is approached by a group of Clerics led by Seedor the
Open-Handed, a dragonborn who clashes well with Corpium.
o
He speaks of the Soapstone Cathedral and that he is headed there after Coal Burg.
o
The two parties join up and head north.
o
They stop to camp and are riddled with horrible depressing dreams.
o
Corpium dreams of a destroyed Grepping with librarian-like residents.
o
Armando dreams of a bottomless pit opening up in the black desert.
o
Eurostras dream of being lost in the desert looking for a mountain similar to the
mountain of truth.
