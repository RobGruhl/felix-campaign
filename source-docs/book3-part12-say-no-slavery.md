# Book Three: In the Eye of the Beholder
## Part 12: Say No to Slavery (Chapters 91-97)

### Description
The party navigates the hostile Dwarflands, fighting slavers and Hair Kings while avoiding the oppressive Peacekeepers. They spark a slave revolution, explore Wish Lake's underwater ruins, and find sanctuary with the dwarven rebellion at the House of Dorin.

### Plot Summary
Aylan has a mysterious dream featuring the black desert and a fake wizard council including human Windyll who pokes his eyes. The party defeats dwarven slavers and takes their badges with closed-eye symbols. They enter the forest where Hair Kings - feral dwarf relatives who eat children - attack, and the party defeats them. A cave with melting walls radiates evil magical energy. Using disguises, they attempt to enter Dwarfgate but are identified by a Peacekeeper - a tall iron construct that dampens spirits. Recognized as "Armando and the Furious Four," they camp outside and fight off slavers and a Peacekeeper, inspiring slaves to revolt. At Wish Lake, Jhornos dives to underwater elven ruins and battles a white whale creature with a humanoid torso, finding a magically preserved sword, elvish metal, a sapphire amulet, and an ancient map showing Larithia's location. The party reaches the House of Dorin, a wealthy rebel sympathizer, and joins the resistance. In the basement headquarters, they win money in fighting pits, discover a creepy cat demon (the "original cat" who turned Magis into a vampire) hiding in their bag, and write letters home.
