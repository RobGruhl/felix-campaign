# Book Four: TBD
## Part 16: Heading North at Last (Chapters 135-141)

### Description
The party finally heads north after defeating Chromium, meeting new ally Tad Poolish and encountering revelations about Eurostras's dual existence. They battle Vermax pirates, fight the Sword Council, visit the Triton capital Lorthos, and finally meet Aquarius the Hidden in the Forest of Horrors.

### Plot Summary
After receiving lordships from the Dwarven king, the party travels through a tunnel to the Wetlands north of the Dwarflands. At the Three Humors tavern, they meet Tad Poolish, a Grung knight who joins their quest after learning about The Library. The perplexing dancer clown manifests and Ilrune VII emerges when forced to wear the ring of truth, revealing his plans to create an "age of truth" by freeing the third Archtruth. The party sets sail in their new triton warship and destroys a Vermax pirate ship, rescuing Tep from a barrel - a former crewmate of Eurostras from the Misty Sound Pirates. Tep reveals that Eurostras existed simultaneously in the north with fractional memory and was crowned king after performing a mysterious song. At Rogue Town, they defeat two members of the Sword Council who were hunting Aylan. They visit Lorthos, the Triton capital, meeting Eurostras II who warns of the approaching castle. In the Forest of Horrors, they encounter Library creatures and eventually find Aquarius the Hidden, the last wizard council member, who enchants their armor and binds a fire elemental for Armando.
