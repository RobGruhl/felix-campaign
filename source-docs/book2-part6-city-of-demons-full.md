the coast to the Glass Citadel in the hopes to regroup and raise funds.
o

gets along very well with Corpium. She is very protective of animals.

Chapter 48: Vultures

The rotted-out part of the map is a range of hills, waterfalls, and rivers, very
serene.

nest with Eros.

distance.

Chapter 49: Hell on Earth
o
Corpium and Indigo arrive at the glass citadel, and it is a little different than
Corpium remembers. The glass went from a green color to a deep red, and
everything seems to be stretched vertically. The streets are a 30-foot-deep pit from
the sidewalk, where drug addled masses trample each other underfoot. People
struggling to stay on the sidewalk barter desperately for yellow ties, similar to
Corpium’s red tie. A fungus-covered demon plows through the pit of people,
dragging lizards on chains. It is emitting a spore like substance which intoxicates
the people around it. Most of the gnomes are missing, replaced with the tieflings,
humans, and lizards that populate the city.
o
Indigo asks a tiefling man what is going on, he says that the old glass authority
was killed a couple days ago, and everyone in the city has been getting
progressively more deranged.
o
Indigo paints Corpium’s tie yellow with her paint supplies.
o
They leave Eros with the stranger and attempt to push their way onto the sidewalk
but are bumped into the pit quickly.
o
They are nearly trampled, and the fungus demon approaches them, but they
escape into the sewer system.
o
They find several pits in the sewer system without a visible bottom.
o
They emerge in the middle of the city, in another street pit, and trick people into
helping them up, and pushing them in when they demand compensation.
o
Corpium and Indigo barter to let Indigo in as a servant, which is begrudgingly
obliged. She was given a yellow tie.
-
Chapter 50: The Upper Glass
o
Corpium and Indigo go up to an ornate room where lizard-folk are having a feast.
The man at the head of the table is Hugor Irontail, the heir to the glass bank and
prospective candidate for the new Glass Authority.

Corpium and Indigo worm their way into the table and discuss the class issues in
the glass citadel.

Ryan.
o

recruit and regroup but were alarmed by the news of Windyll’s passing. Hugor

when Windyll was assassinated.

the tower of authority.

o
The people in the room begin to get rowdier and pay less attention. A yellow
cloud of spores is entering the room. The moderator is visibly intoxicated.
o
The moderator asks who can drink more wine, to applause from the crowd. Ryan
is trying to usher out the intoxicating fog.
o
The priests in charge of the inauguration ritual pull out a stone bowl like Corpium
had encountered before, but with elvish writing on it. They fill it with wine and
hand it to Corpium.
o
Corpium allows his opponent to go first, Hugor gets about halfway through before
he almost throws up.
o
Corpium gets halfway through, and also needs to throw up, but powers through,
throwing up on stage twice.
o
With the fog eradicated, the moderator goes back to normal, and a drunk Corpium
soundly defeats a drunk Hugor in the final question.
