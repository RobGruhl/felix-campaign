# Book 1, Part 2: Full Text (Chapters 11-19)

Chapter 11: Weed Thief
o
The party settles into ship life and meets the crew on board. Khovum’s crew
consists of Slippy the Warrior: a former clown who decided to take up fighting
and a dwarf named Boros Battlestone. Boros likes metal and was very seasick.
o
Also on board was the mysterious rogue/stowaway Viz, who avoids being seen by
the party, for the first few days of travel. Khovum reveals he is taking a matrix of
rot out west and is then heading to the Skulled Ruins in search of magical items.
He also has a rat compass and a pet rat.
o
Viz uses their changeling abilities to transform into Eurostras to steal the pound of
weed from Armando. Viz also disguises themselves as Slippy the Warrior and the
party accidentally communicates with Viz about “The Library” (something Viz
knows about as well).
o
The party holds an emergency meeting to question everyone about the missing
weed. Eurostras talks to the real Slippy about “The Library” and learns firsthand
what the curse affecting all of them is (vomiting black sand and taking damage).
o
Viz tries to sneak by but is detected and the jig is up.
o
Viz introduces themselves to the party and an uneasy alliance is made. The party
also gets the weed back.

Chapter 12: Are We There Yet?
o
The party spends the greater part of a month sailing, fishing, and drinking with
their new companion Viz. They don’t really learn anything about them, but the
common goal of understanding “The Library” unites them and strengthens their
bond.
o
While taking a shift watching the ship, Armando notices two librarians on the ship
watching him but they fly away before anything happens.
o
Eurostras catches around 40 fish.
-
Chapter 13: The Rot Matrix Rots
o
Uh-oh, the rot matrix has started spreading its rot onto the bottom of the ship. The
party tries to fix it with some extra wood lying around and barely slows down the
rotting.
o
They realize that the ship will be destroyed before they make it to land and take
drastic measures to find a place to dock and repair the ship.
o
The party uses their magical leaf to contact Greenwise and ask him for any help,
unfortunately, Greenwise can’t do much and just tells them to meet him in the
glass undercity.
o
The drastic measures include killing Khovum’s pet rat and replacing it with a
disguised Scroty. Doing so allows them to use the rat compass to sail to an
uninhabited group of islands that are not even on the map.
-
Chapter 14: Mysterious Islands
o
The islands are too rocky to dock onto, but Armando and Viz use a rowboat to
head over and investigate. Eurostras follows in the water and Corpium stays on
the ship.
o
The three of them make it to the island and follow the rat compass to a shipwreck.
o
The party grabs as much dry and stable wood plus some barrels of preserved meat
and begins to head back.
o
Corpium notices a creature breaching in the distance and shouts to get the party’s
attention.
o
Eurostras jumps in and notices it is a large undersea worm.
-
Chapter 15: It was an Algrothan Bull Worm!
o
The worms start to catch interest in the party. The party grabs what they can and
runs for it. Eurostras swims ahead and tells Corpium to start cutting the anchor
loose so they can escape faster. Armando and Viz catch up and bring the wood
and meat on board. Corpium and Eurostras toss the meat as distractions for the
worms, but it doesn’t deter them.
o
In order to fight off the worms, Viz shoots at them with a crossbow and Eurostras
dives back into the water.
o
Corpium cuts the anchor loose and they begin to speed off.
o
Slippy tries to help and coats the entire ship in ice.
o
Eurostras hits one of the worms with a Thunderwave and scares it off. He misses
on his second attack and the worm takes a bite out of the ice on the ship.
o
Armando begins repairing the ship with Corpium and Boros.
o
Eurostras scares off the last worm with one final Thunderwave and returns to the
ship.
-
Chapter 16: Arrival West
o
The party spend their last few days at sea relaxing after their unfortunate
encounter.
o
They finally arrive at Beach Town and before they can head for the Glass Citadel,
Boros heads off to the Dwarven Mountains, Khovum heads north to the Skulled
Ruins, and Slippy stays with the party.
o
Just as they are about to head out, Eurostras passes out and enters a coma.
o
The party looks for a doctor, only to find a small clinic run by Hank Popcorn. He
takes some of their gold to look after Eurostras and the party heads off to make a
deal with Greenwise.
o
The party heads to the Glass Citadel.
-
Chapter 17: The Glass Citadel
o
The party arrives in the Glass Citadel and visits the merchants down by the shore.
o
Corpium/Viz tries to steal a banana from a banana stand and the party gets
attention drawn to them.
o
Viz incites a gnome riot by transforming into a gnome and punching another
gnome.
o
The party uses the chaos to escape into an alleyway in the back entrance of a bar.
o
Slippy gets separated from the group.
o
Corpium pretends to be the head chef to make it out to the front. They make it out
front and sit down waiting for the riot to calm down. Armando tells everyone that
Corpium is really sick, so they stay away (dragon covid or something like that).
o
Eurostras dreams he is lost for decades in a huge black sand desert. It is
perpetually dusk, and he sees a silver mountain in the distance which is the same
color as his ring.
o
Eurostras wakes up, pays Hank, and heads off to the Glass Citadel.
o
Tired of his monk attire, Eurostras changes into more suitable clothing and finds a
lute (he keeps his pan flute though).
o
He runs into the dispersed gnome riot and finds the nearest bar.
o
He runs into his party, and they all catch up on what they missed.
-
Chapter 18: The Glass Undercity
o
They ask a shady looking hooded gnome for directions to the undercity, and he
points them in the direction of the bank.
o
At the bank they ask for an elevator down to the undercity and head for the
building that Greenwise instructed them to.
o
The glass undercity is an exact replica of the glass citadel except without any
furniture or people. Also, underground, and dark.
o
They run into Slippy at the building with no sign of Greenwise.
o
To kill time, the party messes with the stone bowl to see if they can put anything
in it. Their most complex attempt was for Viz to place Scroty inside the bowl,
while disguised as a Librarian.
o
The party asks Slippy to step outside.
o
The party learns that Viz can transform into people they see in drawings if the
drawing is really good. Fortunately, Corpium is a talented artist.
o
The bowl does nothing.
o
It is at this moment that Greenwise walks in on the party.
-
Chapter 19: To Find a Wizards Tomb
o
Greenwise starts complaining to Viz who is still disguised as a Librarian, about
how a Librarian dropped the info about “The Library” to him against his will.
o
Viz shifts out after some mild trolling and the party takes advantage of the
situation to ask Greenwise what he knows about Godrick, Silneas, and “The
Library.”
o
Greenwise tells them that Silneas is dead, and his resting place is up north.
o
The party thanks Greenwise for the information and Slippy delivers the rot
matrix.
