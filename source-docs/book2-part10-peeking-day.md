# Book Two: The Divine Comedy
## Part 10: Happy Peeking Day! (Chapters 81-84)

### Description
The party deals with the aftermath of the Gimel incident, fights the vampire Magis to save dwarven refugees, and enjoys downtime in Soapstone. They meet the Northern Delegation who beg for help against the King Beneath the Mountains, and witness the sacred Peeking ceremony where God takes holy men to the celestial realm.

### Plot Summary
With Nun contained in Magis's mansion, the party learns from the vampire about Silneas's golem Mem, built for deep-sea exploration and sent north to find the Mountain of Truth. Dwarven refugees Orin and Drod arrive, explaining their kingdom was taken over by someone claiming to be the prophesied "King Beneath the Mountain." When Magis tries to eat them, the party fights him off and he flees. The party visits the Economic Angel (discovering the evil cat is worth negative 100,000 GP), the Central Cathedral for a blessing, and the Cathedral of Heroes where they see a statue of Ilrune I wielding Patricia II (Dragonsbane). The Northern Delegation - dwarves and tritons - begs the party to dethrone the King Beneath the Mountains, promising the triton fleet and riches. During downtime, party members pursue various activities: Jhornos earns the nickname "Jhornos Deep-blade" and recruits dwarven swordsmen; Bromdir reads the Traveler's Guide to Larithia and swindles people; Armando puts on a circus. Jhornos meets the Dark Professor who brought Nun to Soapstone. On Peeking Day, the party receives gifts from a hero enthusiast and watches God take holy men to the celestial realm.
