Chapter 91: Coward Fight
o
As the party is resting, Aylan has a strange dream in the black desert. He then
moves into his home village and hides himself from being noticed. He comes
across a group of humans who claim to be the wizard council. They talk about
wanting to take down the king beneath the mountain and the human Windyll
pokes Aylan in the eyes, and his dream ends. He shares his mysterious dream with
the party (minus the part about his home village).
o
The party wakes up in the temple to find that the outside city has been
significantly inundated with sand.
o
They look outside to see dwarven slavers looking for Murin, Morim, and Kod.
o
The party decides not to reveal their companions and using Bromdir as bait,
engages the slavers in combat. Before Jhornos can successfully slay one of them,
the dwarves surrender.
o
The party loots them for all their worth, coming across plate armor, love crystals,
battleaxes, and four slaver badges. The slaver coins have a closed eye carved into
them.
o
The slavers tell the party about the dangers that await them in different ways to
get to Dwarfgate, and that Tritons and Tieflings would likely not get in.
o
Jhornos is reluctant to travel underground cementing the party’s decision to travel
through the forest as it is the fastest way to Dwarfgate.
o
The slavers warn the party about Hair Kings, a feral relative of dwarves that
roams the woods and is known to take and eat children.

Chapter 92: The Hair Kings
o
The party enters the forest where Aylan uses his superior knowledge of the woods
to lead them in the fastest direction. As they travel, they come across a clump of
well-kept blond hair.
o
Indigo talks to the moss nearby and discovers that a pack of hair kings was
travelling through here. After some discussion the party decides to track them.
o
They hear a scream in the distance and see a figure in the distance, Jhornos shoots
at it and begins combat with the hair kings.
o
When the party catches up to them, the hair kings devour a dwarf whole and fight
the party.

After some hair-related struggles, the party defeats the hair kings and continues to
travel through the forest.

Chapter 93: Scary Cave
o
The party is getting tired and is looking for a place to rest, but the company of
dwarves tells them it is unsafe to rest in this area.
o
The weary party finds a cave and decides to check if it is a good place to rest. Sir
Goom senses a lot of evil magical energy coming from this cave, and the
members of the party with darkvision (Indigo, Bromdir, Aylan, and Jhornos) can
see that the walls are melting. The party promptly exits.
o
Once leaving the cave, the party runs into a group of slavers. They are quick to
react after failing to sneak away and pretend to be mercenary slavers headed to
Dwarfgate with Indigo disguising herself in wildshape, and the party pretending
to have Bromdir as a captive.

The slavers are convinced, and head out.
