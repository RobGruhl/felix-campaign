# Book Three: In the Eye of the Beholder
## Part 14: Ice Age (Chapters 108-114)

### Description
The party battles wyverns, trains with frost giants, and survives deadly encounters in the frozen north. Bromdir and Indigo get trapped in the Fey realm where Bromdir gambles away his very name, becoming "Sweetie Pie." The party prepares for the final assault on the Ruin-Ringed Mountain.

### Plot Summary
Climbing toward Bornir, the party is attacked by wyverns. Indigo summons giant owls for an aerial battle, and they fly directly over Bornir toward Thoros. Following mammoths to a wellspring of white Library fluid, they encounter frost giants Orok and Dorok who take them to Giantcleft. Weapons master Korloth tests the party's mettle, then trains them for a week. They meet Eastcliff, a former "peacekeeper king" who removed his upgrade through willpower - he reveals the King Beneath the Mountains is a beholder named Chromium who manifests dreams. They meet Denver Scrubs, a barbarian who learned powers from Multibeast. A titan mammoth hunt goes wrong when the frost serpent catches Denver, killing her. Indigo plants her Leshy seed, growing a massive escape plant. Drunk at the giant's tavern, Bromdir and Indigo find a scrying pool - Bromdir sees his sick wife coughing black sand, Indigo sees her daughter with Jasper. That night, a fake version of Indigo's daughter lures them into the Fey realm. They defeat Indigo's evil father Cyan but get lost. At a Fey tavern, Bromdir gambles with a caterpillar named Rupert Penis, eventually losing his name to Cyan - becoming "Sweetie Pie." The party uses a scrying pool to see loved ones, then departs for the final assault.
