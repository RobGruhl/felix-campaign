# Book Three: In the Eye of the Beholder
## Part 11: Journey to the Dwarf Lands (Chapters 85-90)

### Description
The party journeys through the desert toward the Dwarflands, encountering magical oases, storms, and ancient ruins. They meet Sir Goom and discover the undead city of Myon-Thalas, where they defeat the preserved queen who made deals with dark forces.

### Plot Summary
The party heads into the desert and discovers a magical oasis growing from a dead dragon's remains, earning an apple of strength by killing a fruit-stealing raccoon. During a desert storm, Jhornos uses Patricia II as a lightning rod to strengthen it. They battle a cyclops in the sand-swept mountains. Rizzmodeus appears to Armando, upgrading Scroty with fire breath and warning that Mimeoplasm is now advised by "The Alchemist" who has twisted the enemy troops into abominations. In a petrified forest, the party meets Sir Goom, a heroic paladin who knows of The Library. They rescue three dwarves from a mummy and arrive at Myon-Thalas, an undead city where mummies perform sacrifices. After incinerating the mummy horde with a fireball, the party enters the palace and confronts the preserved queen, who has connections to Larithia and made deals with Magis. Sir Goom kills her with a spear through the head.
