# Book 2, Part 8: Full Text (Chapters 66-72)

Chapter 66: The Council Falls
o
The party is plagues with nightmares about the blue pyramid and when they wake
in the inn. They notice that the pyramid has begun to crack.
o
They leave the sleepy time potions in the inn for safekeeping and head out to
investigate.
o
When they arrive, they encounter the entire Wizard Council minus Aquarius the
Hidden with the new member Skithiryx the Laughing Wizard. Greenwise
introduces them and explains that the pyramid is sealing something powerful and
that they need to seal it back up.
o
The party informs the council of the passing of Corpium which does not come off
as a surprise to any of them.
o
The party joins the council in their errand, Armando stays behind to keep an eye
on the potion.
o
Ryan, Greenwise, and Skithiryx, begin to seal the pyramid, but then Skithiryx
disrupts the spell causing the pyramid to rupture. He dashes inside laughing
maniacally and heads towards the magic inside.
o
Ryan and the party chase after him to find him holding a dark purple stone with
the rune “Nun” from the dreidel etched into it.
o
Skithiryx directs energy from the stone into Ryan, destroying his mind. He has no
memories and refers to himself as “smoky the clown.”
o
The party and Greenwise confront the laughing wizard, but at the risk of being
turned into clowns, they let him go.
o
He destroys Krenko’s mind and takes his broom, flying north.
o
The party tries to shoot down Skithiryx, and after he almost gets away, Jhornos
does. The stone falls into the desert and the broom falls to the ground and breaks.

Chapter 67: Greenwise and the Happy Circus
o
Greenwise, apparently the last sane member of the wizard council besides
Aquarius the hidden, is overcome with despair.
o
He warns of horrible things to come now that the oblivion stone has been freed,
and that there is nothing he can do to stop it.
o
The party takes the broken broomsticks, and the stone attacks their mind so they
leave it alone.
o
Jhornos recommends his mom, Striga Vexolhath to reinforce the wizard council.
-
Chapter 68: Dungeons…
o
The party goes to the Glass Citadel. Armando gathers supplies in Beach Town
o
They run into Khovum, the triton collector, selling wares. They buy some trinkets
and ask about the skulled ruins, which he apparently didn’t fully explore.
-
Chapter 69: Skeleton Punchers
o
The party explores the skulled ruins, a catacomb with grey oozes and animated
skeletons.
o
There is a statue of a depiction of Midas and a statue of a tornado of eyes and
mouths. They put a coin in revealing more room to this skulled dungeon.
o
The party takes a long rest in a safe room only to have the nearing hallways filled
with a mob of skeletons that Bromdir takes out in one fell swoop with a bag of
ball bearings.
o
The adventure ends with the party fighting a 9-foot-tall giant skeleton made of
gold wielding a sword and a bag of holding filled with little mechanical dwarves.
o
The skeleton is defeated by Jhornos melting it with a witch-bolt. They put the
golden mass into the bag of holding and Indigo uses her control of moss and other
plants to get the party to safety right as the dungeon collapses.
o
The party reunites with Armando and heads back to the inn.

Chapter 70: The Desert Begins
o
The party (now stocked with all the supplies Armando obtained) heads off into
the desert, travelling by night to ensure they do not get exhausted by the heat.
o
After some travelling Jhornos hears the jingling of bells and starts to freak out. He
alerts the party of a former foe he barely escaped. (Referred to out of character as
the Prismatic Fool). It is a jester in blue, red, and gold wearing a mask.
o
The Fool approaches the party and is accompanied by an entourage with similar
outfits but in black and white. Jhornos explains that it can transfer its
consciousness to others by placing the mask on the body of its fallen enemies.
o
Although at first, they try and flee, the party decides to fight it head on. Jhornos
and Armando fight it directly, while Bromdir tries to snatch its mask multiple
times eventually, succeeding. This Fool is a very strong swordsman, clearly at a
stronger level than Jhornos.
o
They trick the fool into losing its sword and eventually defeat it. Indigo ends up
with the mask and creates a replica.
o
The party continues onward.

Chapter 71: Unholy Cow!
o
The party arrives at the village of Milk. A small farming village built on a natural
spring in the desert.
o
They head into the tavern where they find the entire village celebrating. Jhornos
heads to the barkeep and meets Aylan, a travelling holy person of noble origins
heading on an adventure. They both learn that the villagers are celebrating the end
of times as the town has gone to shit lately.
o
After drinking some subpar and not green beer, the party offers to dig around and
see if they can put a stop to this presumable Armageddon. They drag Aylan along
as they like his vibe.
o
The party discovers the water of the spring has turned to blood and a large
quantity of flies has begun to swarm it.
o
They head into the pastures to find that the cows are also dying. Aylan notices that
one of these cows is not like the other and points it out to the party. Jhornos
identifies it as a Stench-Cow and explains they are very cursed beings to the point
where their souls physically manifest upon being slain. His knowledge ends there
as he has never seen or killed one.
o
With the help of a normal cow, Indigo communicates to the other cows to avoid it
and the party begins their attack.
o
The cow puts up a good fight, with Bromdir riding it several times to subdue it.
The Stench-Cow starts summoning multiple plagues including an indiscriminate
killing of nearby creatures, acid rain, darkness, and flies. It is eventually burned to
a crisp by Armando and its soul was collected. The plagues end and the town are
saved.
o
The party returns to the tavern and tells everyone the problem is solved thanks to
Armando and the Furious Four. A statue will be built to commemorate this.
o
The party sets off north again with Aylan having joined them.
-
Chapter 72: Big Deals
o
The party runs into the Mega Merchant, a giant merchant who had passed through
the town earlier. After some bartering, they purchase an old painting depicting
something unusual with the caption on it saying “The Grand Vision of Larithia” in
elvish. The grammar points that phrase to be the end of a sentence.
o
The party loses 100gp, a mechanical fish, and a golden dagger in this trade. They
also get beads of teleportation (1 each).
o
The Mega Merchant mentions he was kicked out of soapstone for trying to sell
this painting.
o
The party heads on north, finally reaching Soapstone.
