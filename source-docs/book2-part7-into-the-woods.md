# Book Two: The Divine Comedy
## Part 7: Into the Woods (Chapters 58-65)

### Description
Armando returns from his time in the Glass Abyss, reuniting with the party outside the transformed citadel. The group ventures into the Deep Forest to hunt a Wibex for Armando's flame sword, resulting in Corpium's death. They navigate the mystical forest, encounter the Multibeast, and retrieve their dragon sleeping potion.

### Plot Summary
When Armando switched places with Rizzmodeus, he woke in the Glass Abyss where Dionysus spoke to him. He emerges at an inn owned by Bromdir Sparrowcap with gifts from Rizzmodeus - the Eyes of Rizzmodeus to locate people. Armando has disturbing dreams of a hanged purple jester in a blue pyramid. He travels to find the party, picking up Mary the Clown along the way. Reunited, the party learns Eurostras is dead and meets new allies Indigo and Jhornos. Rizzmodeus gives Armando a red sword that needs a Wibex heart to become a fire sword. In the Deep Forest, they find Rickard Gray, a cursed donkey-man whose agony from magic attracts the Wibex. The battle is brutal - Corpium dies from his wounds after charging recklessly into the flaming creature. His soul is pulled toward the Glass Citadel, and he passes his Rizzmodeus pact to Jhornos. Lost in the Deep Forest, the party finds the Multibeast, a forest spirit who reveals himself as the giant bear from earlier. Indigo drinks from his Library pool, gaining the curse. They escape and retrieve their sleeping potion from the Fringe Alchemist, who has transformed with librarian-material arms.
