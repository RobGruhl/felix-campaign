# Book Two: The Divine Comedy
## Part 8: Regroup For the North (Chapters 66-72)

### Description
The party grieves their losses while the Wizard Council faces betrayal from within. They explore the Skulled Ruins for treasure, then begin their desert journey northward, encountering the Prismatic Fool, saving the village of Milk from a plague-cow, and trading with the Mega Merchant.

### Plot Summary
The party rests at Bromdir's inn, plagued by nightmares of the blue pyramid. They notice the pyramid has begun to crack and investigate, encountering the Wizard Council minus Aquarius, plus new member Skithiryx the Laughing Wizard. As they attempt to seal the pyramid, Skithiryx betrays them - he disrupts the spell, enters the pyramid, and emerges with Nun, a dark purple stone that can erase minds. He uses it on Ryan (now "Smoky the Clown") and Krenko before being shot down by Jhornos, though Nun falls into the desert. With the council shattered, Greenwise is overcome with despair. The party explores the Skulled Ruins dungeon, defeating grey oozes, skeletons, and a golden skeleton boss. Equipped with treasure, they head into the desert. They encounter and defeat the Prismatic Fool, a masked jester who can transfer consciousness through its mask - Indigo keeps the mask. At the village of Milk, they meet Aylan, a holy person on adventure, and save the town from a plague-summoning Stench-Cow. Finally, they trade with the Mega Merchant, acquiring an old painting of Larithia and beads of teleportation before reaching Soapstone.
