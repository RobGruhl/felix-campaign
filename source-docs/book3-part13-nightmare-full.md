Chapter 98: One-Half-Hole
o
The party heads off to Half Hole, Jhornos casts water walk to let the party cross a
rather rampant river.
o
They make it to Half Hole and enter the tavern where Goom gets rather drunk and
falls in love with the bartender who reciprocates Goom’s feelings. In the fastest
relationship development to date, they get engaged, all before Jhornos gets his
drink.
o
Jhornos is walking to a table when he bumps into a man who looks exactly like
Armando. He is very rude and claims to be the party’s Armando.
o
He states that he is going to “take a shit” as he is waiting for the furious five to
arrive. He states that he and his party are on their way to defeat the King Beneath
the Mountain.
o
Shortly after, some incredibly offensive depictions of Jhornos and Indigo arrive,
they match the major stereotypes that follow tieflings and tritons. Jhornos
instantly takes it up with his counterpart.
o
Then doppelganger versions of Bromdir, Aylan, and Goom arrive as well.
o
They refer to themselves as “Armando the Demon King,” “Jhornos Deep-blade,”
“Bromdir the Mad-Thief,” “Indigo Faecursed,” “Aylan the Fallen,” and “Goom.”
o
Tensions rise and both parties take it outside, not before other Armando flirts with
Sir Goom’s fiancé, Sir Goom admires Goom’s helmet, Bromdir refuses to play
knife chicken with his counterpart, and Jhornos downs and entire tankard of beer
in front of his counterpart.

Chapter 100: All My Dream Come True
o
The party loots their doppelgangers, and it is revealed that the fake Goom is a
goliath. They make their peace with each other (sort of), and Aylan tries but fails
to heal Jhornos’ eye back. Jhornos takes Gouger for himself.
o
After the party cleans themselves up, it is time for Sir Goom, and the bartender
Evelyn to get married. It is a beautiful service.
o
The following day, the party summons Rizzmodeus via goat sacrifice to get some
answers about the fake party.
o
Rizzmodeus (who arrives in human form bursting from the goat), is just as
confused as the party.
o
After some serious interrogation tactics and Aylan banishing fake Jhornos to his
original plane, the party witnesses a mysterious red storm in the sky. The
following discoveries are made:
▪
The king beneath the mountains has dreams so vivid they manifest into
reality; the fake party and the fake wizard council were most likely created
this way.
▪
The plane of dreams is real, connected to the black desert, and explains the
bizarre dreams the party has been having.
▪
“The nightmare storm” occurs sporadically, for stretches of a day to a
week, it has nightmarish and unpredictable effects, sometimes spherical
objects are spotted flying around. It originates from the ruin-ringed
mountain and diminishes in effect throughout the land.
o
After this, the party puts the ring of truth onto their old painting about Larithia
that had turned black and make the following discoveries:
▪
The painting once depicted a beautiful flying castle in the ancient and
powerful magic city with no text.
▪
The ancient and powerful magic city was once called Larithia, but the
name vanished suddenly a few years after Rizzmodeus was banished.
▪
Rizzmodeus, Midas, and Dionysus were imprisoned by the King Ilrune
VII using a powerful magic tech weapon.
o
With all this information, the party decides to rest in Half Hole to weather the
storm.
o
Evelyn decides to travel with the party.
-
Chapter 101: Safe Word
o
The party rests in Evelyn’s house avoiding the nightmare storm.
o
Jhornos brings up the fact that the King Beneath the Mountain clearly has some
connection to the loss of eyes:
▪
The slaver coins with closed eyes
▪
The sword Gouger
▪
The eyes from the nightmare storm
▪
The dream wizard council poking Aylan’s eyes
▪
Dream Bromdir’s eye game.
o
He also brings up the fact that this nightmare storm and the King Beneath the
Mountain might have something to do with Ilrune the Dreamer King.
o
Finally, he suggests that everyone shares a secret to ensure that the party can
identify each other if more realistic dream versions arrive.
▪
Jhornos admits he was the one to unleash the historian on his village
(accidentally). It was after something called the “Dragon Archives.”
▪
Bromdir admits he was part of the glass citadel grips, a deadly gang that
roams the streets. They fought the Pluds who slaughtered nearly all the
Grips. He met his mentor Eaglehat who taught him a lot of what he knows
and how to help the poor.
▪
Sir Goom admits his mother died when he was young when she gave birth
to his younger sister. He resents her for this. His dad did not like that, he
resented his sister and sent her away.
▪
Aylan admits his real name is Syllin, and that he is wanted for the murder
of his father that he did not commit.
▪
Armando was born with a tail, and it was chopped off at birth.
▪
Indigo reluctantly admits that she has 13 months of her life that she does
not remember and refuses to use the ring of truth to find out what they are.
o
After everyone shares, they decide to take a nap and see if they can access their
dreams. Everyone’s dream was corrupted by the nightmare storm.
-
Chapter 102: One-Whole-Hole
o
Evelyn wakes up the party to mention the large eye that has materialized.
o
Without being spotted, the party creates fog in front of the eye.
o
Indigo lucid dreams, dreaming of Half Hole. In her dream, eyes are in different
places. They eventually manifest.
o
Bromdir shoots the eye, when the eye is damaged the storm intensifies and blood
rains down on Half Hole.
o
The halflings run to hide in the “Full Hole” on the outskirts of town; the party
helps them escape as eyes open everywhere.
o
One of the circles descends over the town, its silhouette includes several tentacles
protruding from it.
o
Indigo summons spiders to help lower the party into the hole with web.
o
In the full hole, it is too deep for the storm to reach. The town is safe, for now.
-
Chapter 103: The Serpent Ruins
o
Upon gathering everyone, the party notices a crack leading to some ruins. They
remember Evelyn saying that the town’s famous tomb raider thief was killed
there, and nobody had gone in since. She possessed magic thieves’ gloves.
o
The party decides to explore the ruins to kill time, leaving Armando to guard the
townspeople.
o
The ruins are sideways, and partially submerged in brackish water.
o
The party battles an Earth Myrmidon, and in the process discovers a librarian’s
chrysalis. Jhornos lands the killing blow on the Myrmidon and takes its oversized
gauntlets.
o
They find a room where the dwarven rune for “madness” is carved over and over.
o
They find a mural depicting the serpent, octopus, and dragon they’d seen a couple
times before.
o
The party finds a giant mushroom, Indigo talks to it and discovers it is preventing
the river from fully flooding the ruins.
o
The party checks under some rubble and discovers the central room.
-
Chapter 104: They Used My Government Name
o
Inside the central room is a clock mechanism and some gears, there is also a red
and white jester eating the goo and stuff out of a librarian’s chrysalis.
o
Jhornos jumps down, tossing Bromdir at the jester, it explodes into 6 copies of
itself. They say “Jhornos Vexolhath!” when they see him.
o
They want the sword of truth and consider Jhornos a potential rival for it.
o
Aylan summons little angels that make quick work of the jesters.
o
Jhornos uses the mechanism to rotate the ruin, once it is upright the water drains
from it.
o
The party explores the previously submerged section, finding the skeleton of the
halfling adventurer and a giant dead catfish. Bromdir gets the thieves’ gloves,
Goom filets the fish and discovers the meat is magic and it has an organ filled
with a size boosting fluid.
o
The party goes into a tunnel only accessible when the ruin is upright.
-
Chapter 105: Happy Birthday!
o
They find a serpent statue wearing an authentic historian mask. There are several
librarian chrysalises and one archivist chrysalis. The archivist is a skeletal bug
thing with a white head.
o
Indigo tries to hide behind the mask like a bug, but rapidly ages in the mask’s
presence, by more than a year.
o
An archivist emerges from the chrysalis and demands the party make offerings to
it to spare their lives, it is not interested in Bromdir’s gold. Bromdir tries to offer
it the historian’s mask, and then throws it at the archivist, initiating combat.
o
Indigo summons a serpent to destroy the Historian mask, it destroys the mask.
o
Jhornos and Sir Goom drink the fluid to become huge, Jhornos uses gouger to
destroy the Archivist’s skull, preventing it from dilating time.
o
Jhornos uses the myrmidon gauntlets in his huge form.
o
Aylan temporarily banishes the archivist, letting the party focus on the librarians.
o
Aylan
deflects
6
successive
attacks
while
holding concentration on his
banishment.
o
Bromdir makes a break for it, to search for items to help with battle/find
Armando. He finds 700 gold.
o
Jhornos is blinded but uses the elixir of health. This also restores his missing eye.
o
When the archivist comes back, it is beaten within an inch of its life by Jhornos
and his mighty gauntlets.
o
It surrenders and decides to give the party information.
-
Chapter 106: Knowledge Acquisition
o
After our battle, I have determined you are beings of importance in this realm, so
instead of wasting this body I will impart knowledge onto you.
o
One of the librarians speaks: We cannot share information about the library at
will, it costs us power in this realm. That librarian crumbles into black sand as it
speaks.
o
The second librarian speaks: We cannot die by physical means. When this
archivist returns to the library, they will record everything they learned from you
in The Historian’s archive. The second librarian disintegrates.
o
The third librarian says: we were not drawn here by choice, rather by the nature of
this profane monument to an Archtruth. It disintegrates.
o
The fourth librarian says: as mortals, it would be wise to fall behind the clown
messiah. He is not one of us but is someone who has sacrificed much for the sake
of mortal curiosity. His return is fast approaching.
o
The fifth librarian says: Continue to seek The Library. If you wish for knowledge
or power, you will find it there.
o
The sixth and final librarian says: We cannot tell you how to reach it, it is outside
of our power at this time.
o
The Archivist, mangled from Jhornos’ punch, only consists of a ribcage and an
arm and a leg. They say: if you have a question, ask it now.
o
Indigo asks about the Archtruths, the Archivist says there are three, the
Alchemist, the Historian, and one other that it cannot name.
o
It tells Indigo the location of the underwater ruin that helps see in the Fey realm,
needed to reach the mountain of truth.
o
The Archivist disintegrates.
o
The party loots the rest of the dungeon, Bromdir triggers a trap that causes it to
rotate, and sneaks into the mechanism to disarm it.
o
The party finds a sanctuary where they can rest.
-
Chapter 107: Waiting Out the Storm
o
The party waits with the dwarves and halflings in the cave while the Nightmare
Storm rages.
o
The party learns about Indigo’s long lost younger sister, and missing years of her
life.
o
Indigo puts on the ring of truth and discovers that her sister was her daughter, and
her parents cursed her out of this knowledge.
o
Indigo is devastated and filled with a great rage.
o
A creature begs to be let in the hole, it claims to have been transformed into a
triton and it is a vile toothy creature with many eyes.
o
The party cannot trust it, and let it die.
o
They give it a proper burial.
o
Jhornos mentions his life before joining the furious 5.
▪
-Jhornos left Port Shell town when he was 18 (It took him two years to
fully heal from his fight with the historian)
▪
-He spent the first year travelling from town to town slaying any minor
monsters he came across and ridding towns of nuisances such as bandits
and such
▪
-Towards the end of his first year he first encounters the fool and
witnesses him transfer his consciousness to another host, he fights the fool
and barely manages to escape with his life. Out of fear he does not stop
running until he passes out and wakes up in a field at night. That night he
has some sort of dream/vision.
▪
-A month later he runs into Adphyra Cedarpetal, a moon elf swordswoman
with a baby fox. They have a brief duel and when the two realize they are
evenly matched decide to travel together and fight monsters. They both
travelled together for about two and a half years.
▪
-About six months before Jhornos reaches the glass citadel they both
encounter the fool and are desperately outmatched. In a desperate move,
Jhornos creates his first Thunderwave launching the fool off a cliff
(obviously not killing him but ending the fight).
▪
-In the next town Jhornos and Adphyra part ways after she decides to stay
and help with some monster troubles while Jhornos insists he must keep
moving. It was a painful goodbye as the two had truly grown fond of each
other both as warriors and as people.
o
The storm clears, and the party heads North
