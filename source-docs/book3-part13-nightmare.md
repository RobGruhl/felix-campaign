# Book Three: In the Eye of the Beholder
## Part 13: Nightmare, Nightmare, Nightmare (Chapters 98-107)

### Description
The party encounters evil doppelgangers of themselves, survives a devastating Nightmare Storm, explores serpent ruins containing Library creatures, and discovers devastating truths about Indigo's past. The nightmare storm reveals the King Beneath the Mountains can manifest dreams into reality.

### Plot Summary
At Half Hole, Sir Goom falls in love with bartender Evelyn and gets engaged immediately. The party encounters doppelgangers of themselves - offensive stereotypes claiming to be "Armando and the Furious Five" heading to defeat the King. In battle, Jhornos loses his left eye to "Gouger," a sword that targets eyes, but the party defeats their evil counterparts. They summon Rizzmodeus who reveals the King Beneath the Mountains has dreams so vivid they manifest into reality - explaining the doppelgangers. The party examines their blackened Larithia painting with the ring of truth, discovering it once showed a flying castle and that Larithia's name vanished after Rizzmodeus was banished. A red Nightmare Storm arrives, manifesting eyes everywhere. The party shelters in "Full Hole" and explores serpent ruins containing Library creatures including an Archivist - a skeletal bug thing with time-dilation powers. The Archivist reveals there are three Archtruths: The Alchemist, The Historian, and one unnamed. The librarians encourage seeking The Library and following the Clown Messiah. Finally, Indigo uses the ring of truth and discovers her "younger sister" was actually her daughter, and her parents cursed away this knowledge - leaving her devastated.
