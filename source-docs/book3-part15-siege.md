# Book Three: In the Eye of the Beholder
## Part 15: The Siege (Chapters 115-134)

### Description
The epic assault on the Ruin-Ringed Mountain and the Iron Brain, lair of Chromium the beholder. The party loses Bromdir to a demon's gamble, faces countless trials, and ultimately defeats the King Beneath the Mountains in a climactic battle that claims many lives.

### Plot Summary
The party takes the long route around the Worldscar. They encounter robed peacekeepers with bronze masks through which Chromium possesses people. R. Mondo II is publicly executed via the giant bronze eye laser. A clown manifests and gives them a scroll for Ryan's smoke ring spell, warning of "the castle beneath the dream." The party enters the Ruin-Ringed Mountain, fighting rust monsters and myconid fungus, meeting ghost kings bound to defend the sanctuary. They complete various ghost quests - defeating Cooking Pot Jack for Dalton the Hungry, earning fire armor from the Fire King's trial. Chromium tricks them into an ambush, and they escape while Orin and Drod die to spectator rays. In the Howling Ruin, they encounter the Elder Oblex - a powerful psychic ooze that possesses Jhornos and forces him to wear the fool mask. Sweetie Pie saves him with the ring of truth, shattering the mask and briefly manifesting Ilrune VII (who tries to melt the ring). The party enters the Iron Brain, causing a massive explosion and fighting through radiation. In the hunting grounds, they recruit more dwarves. During a battle against the Regal Aspect, Bromdir is dropped from the mountain. Midas offers him a devil's bargain - wings to survive in exchange for Russian roulette with his wife's life. Bromdir loses and kills his wife, then immediately commits suicide. Jhornos, enraged, single-handedly defeats the Regal Aspect and spectators. With Rizzmodeus's help (trading away the Glass Citadel deal for Bromdir's remains), the party confronts Chromium. In a dreamworld battle, Armando dies but is revived. Jhornos kills Chromium by throwing Patricia II through him. The party escapes as the bronze eye falls, finds Reality Shards, and receives lordships from the grateful Dwarven king.
