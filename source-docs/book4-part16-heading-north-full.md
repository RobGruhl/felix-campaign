o
The party gets an escort through a tunnel to the Wetlands north of the Dwarflands.
o
They meet the northern delegation at a tavern called the Three Humors, and they
are thanked and presented with a boat.
o
At the tavern they meet Tad Poolish, a local Grung knight of great status. He has
an unending thirst and goes by Poolish to distinguish himself from his many
ancestors named Tad.
o
The red and white clown the party previously defeated manifests next to Jhornos,
Armando and Tad.

and that he no longer fears Jhornos as a rival.
o
Jhornos forces the ring of truth onto his hand.
o
As with the prismatic fool, the perplexing dancer shatters and Ilrune VII emerges.
o
The party convinces him not to melt the ring and gets him to explain himself.
o
Ilrune talks about how he confronted the platinum dragon and failed to get the
sword of truth, and how he plans to create an age of truth by severing the chains at
the bottom of the library, and freeing the third Archtruth, who he knows but
cannot name. Ilrune is unfamiliar with the clown shenanigans.
o
Ilrune removes the ring and melts away.
o
During the conversation the party finds out that Tad knows about The Library, and
he found out about it quite recently.

Chapter 136: Old Friend Slightly Forgotten
o
The party sets off in their new triton warship, equipped with ballista, a map of the
world, and a triton diving suit.
o
They encounter a colossal ship belonging to the Vermax pirates, piloted by
upwards of fifty green kobolds. Their leader is said to be the Pirate-Dragon
Vermax, who terrorizes the northern half of the Mystic Sea.
o
Jhornos instructs Gimel to ram the ship into the side of the Vermax ship, they pull
it off and destroy the hull, causing treasure and kobolds to spill out.
o
Armando uses a water elemental to levitate himself above the water and casts a
fireball into the ship’s hull, sinking it.
o
The kobolds attempt to commandeer the party’s ship, but are subdued, some are
kept as prisoners.
o
Jhornos retrieves treasure and a barrel from the sinking ship. The barrel contains
Tep, who had been captured by the pirates and belonged to the misty sound
pirates with Eurostras.
o
Tep tells us that Eurostras existed simultaneously in the northern region with
fractional memory, including the first few notes of a profound song he learned
from a philosopher. After performing those few notes, he was heralded as a savior
and crowned king. The nature of the song eluded all who studied it. This
Eurostras died at the same time as Armando’s, and behaved strangely while
Eurostras possessed the ring of truth. His son, Eurostras II, rules the triton
kingdom.
