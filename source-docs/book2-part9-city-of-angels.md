# Book Two: The Divine Comedy
## Part 9: The City of Angels (Chapters 73-80)

### Description
The party arrives in Soapstone during the sacred Peeking Festival when God visits. They explore the forbidden Dead Zone, encounter the vampire Magis, and discover the Oblivion Stone Nun among stolen gifts. When Gimel absorbs Nun, he transforms into a terrifying 20-foot platinum golem that must be stopped with the help of angels.

### Plot Summary
Armando and the Furious Four arrive in Soapstone, a holy city of cathedrals and real angels, during the Peeking Festival - a seven-day event every seven years when the Grand Celestial (God) visits. They cash in their dungeon gold at the Economic Angel's market cathedral for 8,000 gold and learn about the Dead Zone, where angels cannot tread. Investigating, they enter the Dark Cathedral and battle shadows before discovering the vampire Magis has stolen the festival gifts. Magis, an old friend of Silneas Silvertongue, explains he's searching for something Library-related. Among the gifts, they find Nun - the Oblivion Stone. They summon Gimel to investigate, but he's entranced and absorbs the stone, transforming into a 20-foot platinum golem with four arms and devastating power. Gimel repeatedly says "North" and declares Silneas is not his master. The party retreats and rallies Justice (the largest angel) and twenty other angels. In the battle, angels go blind from looking at Gimel, bleeding black goo. Jhornos destroys Gimel with magic missile, reverting him to the dreidel. Nun then corrupts civilians, and Aylan wrangles it back into the Dark Cathedral.
