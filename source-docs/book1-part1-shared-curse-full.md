# Book 1, Part 1: Full Text (Chapters 1-10)

Chapter 1: Staff Collection
o
Eurostras wakes up in the silver tower’s dungeon after the ring has been put on
with Armando and Whortheus confused as hell.
o
Eurostras reveals that he was once a pirate with a 25-year gap in his memory and
has somehow returned due to the rings magic. Prior to this the party only knew
him as a nameless Monk (player alias “Him”).
o
After some back-and-forth catch up, Armando and Whortheus explain that they
have all been hired by the Wizard Council to find and secure the staff of Silneas
Silvertongue (a staff that can control dragons) and they are in another dimension
inside the ruins of a tower.
o
They thought they were accompanied by a nameless monk in Eurostras’ body.
o
The party locates the staff and both Armando and Eurostras attempt to hold it with
no avail since the staff is really hot (not sexy).
o
The party also finds some boots of stealth, a cloak of billowing, and a ring of fire
detection.
o
Shortly after, a Nothic reveals itself and opens a trap door into a room full of
various bones. It then reanimates some zombies and attacks the party.
o
The party fights off the Nothic and its zombies with success. During the fight,
Eurostras uses his mage hand to wield the staff and reanimates part of a dragon
corpse to burn down a door.
o
Before being slain, the Nothic goes feral due to some powder it inhaled. Its final
words prior to losing it were “The Wizard Council sends its regards.”
o
The party collects the staff and using an underwater passage, escapes the tower
once and for all.
o
They decide to rest and when awoken, the staff is gone and all that remains is a
dreidel, and a thank you note from Godrick the Golden.
o
The party uses the dreidel and summons Gimel the Golden Golem: a helpful and
kind golem filled with Gelt.
-
Chapter 2: Don’t Poke the Bear
o
The party amidst their new discovery of Gimel is visited by Krenko of the Wizard
Council.
o
The party explains that Godrick was not the member of the council who hired
them, and all was forgiven.
o
The party decides to head back to Waterdeep to talk to other council members and
get some grub.
o
On the way back they encounter a bear in a field of flowers. Whortheus pokes the
bear and is critically wounded.
o
In an attempt to save Whortheus, Eurostras casts Thunderwave, which does scare
off the bear, but kills Whortheus in the process.
o
The party buries Whortheus and places his wizard orb inside Shin (Gimels second
form).
o
Shortly thereafter, the party encounters Corpium, Whortheus’ brother who was in
the area looking for him. He seemed indifferent to the news of his brother’s
passing (Eurostras omits the detail of who ended his brother’s life) as they were
estranged.
o
He decides to join the party and heads to Waterdeep on account of there being loot
involved.
-
Chapter 3: Wizard Council
o
The party arrives in Waterdeep and heads to a tavern called “The Busted Bottle,”
and grabs some drinks and food.
o
Right before entering, the party meets Squigley the Clown. A homeless clown
who only knows clowning. She asks the party for some money, but nothing comes
out of it. She also does some tricks with fire magic.
o
Armando is uneasy.
o
Corpium befriends a sad little man at the bar and tricks him into giving the party
some money.
o
Eurostras asks the bartender about the Misty Sound Pirates (his former crew prior
to losing his memory) with very little success. The only thing he could learn was
some sort of tragedy around when his memory fades out involving
guerillas/gorillas.
o
The party spends the night at the tavern and asks for directions to the Wizard
Council headquarters.
o
The party is let into the headquarters and meets up with the Wizard Ryan.
o
Ryan tells the party that he needs people to pursue Godrick the Golden to get the
staff back. He gives them tickets to a luxury cruise and money to go shopping for
nice clothes (so simple!!! How could anyone fuck this up?? :D).
-
Chapter 4: Sword Robbery
o
The party goes clothes shopping at “Idelius Fashion” and gets themselves some
really nice clothes (Corpium gets the clothes pictured in his character model).
o
Eurostras goes sword shopping at “Poronin” since “Him” was unarmed
(excluding a shitty hammer). He finds the nicest sword shop in town and
unfortunately is too broke to buy any of the fancy swords (Including a 10,000gp
legendary sword).
o
He opts for the bargain barrel and comes across a sword he names “Grandmas
Comfort” due to the ugly grandmas-couch looking pattern painted on the blade.
o
Eurostras tries to bargain for a Katana to no avail.
o
Corpium and Armando really want that legendary sword and try to rob the store in
broad daylight.
o
This ensues a battle between them and the security guards that escalates rather
quickly.
o
Confused, Eurostras seeks Ryan in order to get help and try and end the fight.
o
Ryan arrests all three of them.
o
Armando uses Charm Person on Ryan which creates a bond between the two and
gets him a fairer prison sentence.
-
Chapter 5: Jail/A Second Chance
o
Corpium and “Him” awaken in prison, and learn they are about to be executed
(Everyone got their possessions stripped from them, including Eurostras’ ring).
Due to his successful charming of Ryan, Armando is in a much better situation (a
month in jail or something).
o
Ryan asks Armando if the party is willing to go on a dangerous mission in order
to clear their names.
o
Armando agrees and the party is teleported out of the jail by Ryan with almost all
their possessions returned to them (Ryan takes the cloak of billowing due to it
being dangerous).
o
The party gathers their possessions (Eurostras gets his ring back on) and is briefed
on their mission. The mission is to defeat a great evil at the top of Plynach
mountain.
o
Once they get all the details, the party sets off.
-
Chapter 6: Clowning Around
o
The party leaves Waterdeep and travels along a path towards the mountain.
o
On the way they are stopped by Blinko the clown who asks Corpium if he is “The
Clown Messiah.” Corpium lies and says yes, but Blinko sees through the lie.
o
He tells them about Clown Town and how they are all struggling. He also
mentions that the Clown Messiah will save them all.
o
Blinko demonstrates some electric magic. Armando is uneasy.
o
The party moves on.
o
Armando reveals he is really scared of clowns.
o
The party enters a forest and is met with Clowneater the Troll.
o
He asks them if they are clowns because if they are he will eat them.
o
The party convinces him they are not clowns and points it in the direction of
Clown Town.
o
Clowneater wanders away.
-
Chapter 7: The Mountain
o
As the party continues to travel, the forest fades away and they find themselves
traveling up a mountain.
o
At some point the party reaches an ice wall that is too steep to climb.
o
After a few different attempts, they use Gimmel to make hand holds up the ice
wall and climb up shortly after using some ropes.
o
Later on, the party does the same thing again for another ice wall.
o
Finally, the party arrives at the ruins of a cathedral and its surrounding town.
o
The party feels like they are being watched.
o
The party searches the surrounding town and finds nothing but some broken
pieces of a golden frame and a golden statue which they both take.
o
They take a rest and head into the cathedral afterwards.
-
Chapter 8: A Great Evil
o
They examine the cathedral and come across a bowl filled with a strange, milky,
liquid in the center of the room.
o
The party tries pouring out the bowl, but the liquid magically refills.
o
After several other experiments, the party concludes that drinking the bowl’s
contents is the only way to successfully drain the liquid.
o
They take turns drinking from the bowl, getting progressively sicker with each
sip. Armando becomes temporarily blind as a result.
o
After finishing the liquid black sand starts to fall from the ceiling, pooling itself
within the bowl.
o
A black winged skeleton emerges from the sand and greets the party.
o
The creature offers the party great power far greater than anything the wizard
council is capable of.
o
The creature tells them about “The Library” and through the bargaining of
magical artifacts (Broom, stealth boots, ring of fire detection) the party learns that
the creature is on good terms Silneas Silvertongue, that “The Library” is where it
comes from, but doesn’t know the location, and that he doesn’t know what
happened to the Misty Sound Pirates (same info the tavern guy gave).
o
The creature mentions that he recognizes Eurostras (or maybe “Him”).
o
The conversation is interrupted by a goblin who reveals that the creatures name is
“Librarian.” It hands him a ring and disintegrates. The Librarian places the ring in
the bowl, and it turns to black sand and disappears.
o
Seeing that, the party refuses the librarian’s offer. Bored, the Librarian begins to
fly away but is stopped by the party who engages it in combat.
o
The party quickly realizes that the Librarian was resistant to magic, but they
manage to defeat it with physical attacks. It collapses and disintegrates into black
sand. As it disintegrated, the Librarian states that knowledge of “The Library” is a
heavy burden.
o
Confused and concerned, the party tires to make sense of their quest and decides
to head back to Ryan. They pick up the stone bowl and take it with them.
-
Chapter 9: Return to Ryan
o
The party travels down the mountain and through the forest.
o
The party returns to Waterdeep and buys a duffel bag from a shopkeeper clown
that they swindle using the “treasure” from the ruins.
o
The shopkeeper clown tells them news of a troll that rampaged through Clown
Town.
o
They needed a bag to hide the stone bowl from Ryan.
o
They take a rest at “The Busted Bottle” and head to the Wizard Council HQ the
next morning.
o
Once they meet back up with Ryan, he rewards them with gold and a lifting of
their sentences. The party hides any information they gained as they worry it
might get them in trouble.
o
They ask Ryan where Silneas Silvertongue was last seen, and he tells them he was
last seen on the Western continent.
o
The party makes plans to head West and splits up to acquire the appropriate
supplies.
-
Chapter 10: Voyage Prep
o
The party decides to meet back up at “The Busted Bottle” once preparations are in
order.
o
Armando stays behind to get some of Ryan’s weed (He buys 1 pound) and is also
gifted with some magical leaves to contact Ryan’s dealer when they run out.
Ryan’s dealer is the Wizard Council member Greenwise.
o
Corpium heads off to “Becca’s Bakery” to purchase rations for the journey. He
buys a ton of bread and gets some free donuts in return.
o
Eurostras heads to the port, to find a ship to charter. He talks to some Lizardfolk
merchants but decides that traveling with them is not the best course of action.
o
He sees a hooded figure on a one-person boat, and steers clearly away.
o
He finally decides on a simple looking ship captained by a Triton named Khovum
Pamarath. Khovum agrees to let them travel for free as long as they help with ship
duties.
o
The party meets back up and heads off to Khovum’s ship.
o
They arrive at the ship and board.
