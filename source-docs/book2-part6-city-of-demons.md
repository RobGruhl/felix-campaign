# Book Two: The Divine Comedy
## Part 6: The City of Demons (Chapters 47-57)

### Description
After the devastating losses of Book One, Corpium carries on alone, arriving at a transformed Glass Citadel now ruled by chaos and demons. Through political maneuvering and combat, he becomes the Glass Authority and must navigate deals with three imprisoned demon lords.

### Plot Summary
Corpium wakes to find Eros in a coma and travels along the coast toward the Glass Citadel, meeting the coastal druid Indigo along the way. They survive a vulture attack and arrive to find the city completely transformed - the glass has turned red, streets are now 30-foot pits filled with drugged masses, and demons roam freely. The old Glass Authority Windyll has been assassinated. Corpium enters the political race for the new Glass Authority, debating against Hugor Irontail while dealing with intoxicating demon spores. He wins the election and undergoes a painful inauguration ritual where his bones are replaced with strange artifacts. Now he hears the voices of imprisoned demons Dionysus, Midas, and Rizzmodeus, all begging for release. Jhornos Vexolhath, a tiefling hired to assassinate Corpium, is defeated and joins the party instead. After stabilizing the city, Corpium negotiates with all three demons and ultimately frees Rizzmodeus in exchange for promises of protection and aid.
