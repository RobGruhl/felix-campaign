# Book One: The Ring of Truth
## Part 4: The Golden Wizard (Chapters 28-36)

### Description
The party travels through war-torn lands, encounters Godrick the Golden at his war camp, learns the truth about the Clown Messiah and the Waterdeep Project, and accidentally summons a terrifying Historian that reveals the deeper horrors connected to The Library.

### Plot Summary
After leaving Silneas's tomb, Viz falls into a coma. The party leaves them with a kind gnome family and continues through the war-torn plains, fighting leech-covered goblins. At Godrick's war camp, they infiltrate his tent and learn he's trying to tame a dragon using the Staff of Silneas. A clown named Flibbidy arrives claiming visions from the Clown Messiah - and Godrick recognizes him as his father. Using the Ring of Truth, the party discovers that the clowns are actually brainwashed wizards from the "Waterdeep Project." They learn Gimel's fourth personality, Nun, stores all the stolen magical knowledge. When they experiment with the stone bowl, they accidentally summon not a Librarian but a far more terrifying Historian, which destroys the war tent and curses Godrick with Library knowledge before fleeing toward the magic city. The party sets off toward Coal Burg and Soapstone Cathedral.
