# Book One: The Ring of Truth
## Part 2: The Journey West (Chapters 11-19)

### Description
The party sails across the sea on Captain Khovum's ship, dealing with a shapeshifting stowaway, a rotting ship crisis, and giant undersea worms before arriving at the western continent and navigating the chaotic Glass Citadel.

### Plot Summary
Aboard Khovum Pamarath's ship, the party meets the changeling rogue Viz who steals Armando's weed while disguised as other crew members. When the rot matrix cargo begins destroying the ship, they detour to mysterious islands where they battle Algrothan Bull Worms. Upon arriving at Beach Town, Eurostras falls into a coma and the party continues to the Glass Citadel. There, Viz incites a gnome riot as a distraction, and the party eventually reunites and descends to the Glass Undercity to meet Greenwise. They learn Silneas Silvertongue is dead but his resting place lies to the north.
