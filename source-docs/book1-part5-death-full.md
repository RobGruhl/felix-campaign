After making a deal with the doctor, they find a bed for Eurostras, Corpium
shaves his mustache and glues it to Eurostras’ face to make him think he’s grown
a beard.
o
They find the weapons expert, Skavrak Rockriver. He explains that his weapons
were extorted out of him by the freelance military group “The Three Frogs.” He
mentions that their leader wields Dragonsbane, a legendary great axe that was
charged in the High Storm and used to slay the last dragon-king of the magic city,
ending the Age of Dragons, and beginning the second age, the Age of
Enlightenment.

that sold the frogs their poison.

can but it will take 2 weeks, and cost either 300 gold, or the hand of a cursed man.
o
Skavrak explains that the axe is sharpened magically by powerful electric shocks.
o
The fringe alchemist agrees to start working on the potion but is untrustworthy of
the party. He says he will trust them if they drink a white potion, he will not tell
them any details about it.

milk, and that he can trust them now.
