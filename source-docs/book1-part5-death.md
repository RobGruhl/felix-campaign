# Book One: The Ring of Truth
## Part 5: Death (Chapters 37-46)

### Description
The party faces their darkest hours in the deadly forest surrounding "HQ," losing multiple members to carnivorous plants and the demon lord Rizzmodeus's intervention, ending Book One with devastating losses.

### Plot Summary
While Eurostras enters another coma, the party meets Clerence (a follower of God who learned of The Library through dreams) and Eros (a monk who knew "Him"). In Coal Burg, they defeat "The Three Frogs" mercenaries and acquire the legendary axe Dragonsbane. They commission a dragon-sized sleeping potion from the eccentric Fringe Alchemist. The party fights through an army of frogs and chimps before entering the mysterious "HQ" forest grown by Greenwise. Inside, they find an overturned furnace with magical matrix artifacts. Carnivorous plant tornadoes attack - Clerence is killed, and when everyone is grappled, Armando desperately calls upon Rizzmodeus. The demon lord manifests, burns everything, and walks away speaking of plans set in motion. Eurostras is killed by the plants. Corpium barely survives, taking the Ring of Truth from Eurostras's corpse and escaping the inferno with an unconscious Eros. Book One ends with only Corpium and Eros surviving, Armando's fate unknown.
