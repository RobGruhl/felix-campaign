# Book One: The Ring of Truth
## Part 3: It's Getting Silneas (Chapters 20-27)

### Description
The party explores Silneas Silvertongue's underground tomb complex, entering a magical painting to explore his fractured memories, and discovers he is alive but insane after returning from The Library.

### Plot Summary
In the Gnome Forest, the party finds Silneas's tomb beneath an unassuming house. They encounter gaunt painters serving the supposedly dead wizard and a custodian who guards his secrets. Descending deeper, they meet Zayin, a torso of a golem like Gimel who explains that paintings preserve Silneas's shattered mind. They learn Silneas is the only known person to return from The Library, but he needs the Ring of Truth from the Mountain of Truth to restore his sanity. A basilisk attacks to steal the ring, but the party defeats it and enters Silneas's memory-painting. Inside, they explore the Silver Tower in the past, share backstories, and finally reach the black desert where Silneas lies alive but mad in a stone coffin. As librarians swarm the painting-world, the party escapes and resolves to travel north to find the Mountain of Truth.
