# Book One: The Ring of Truth
## Part 1: The Shared Curse (Chapters 1-10)

### Description
The campaign begins with three adventurers discovering the Ring of Truth in a silver tower dungeon, embarking on a mission for the Wizard Council to recover the Staff of Silneas, and facing their first encounter with the mysterious Library.

### Plot Summary
Eurostras awakens in the silver tower's dungeon with Armando and Whortheus, revealing his pirate past and 25-year memory gap. The party recovers the Staff of Silneas Silvertongue only to have it stolen by Godrick the Golden. They travel to Waterdeep to meet the Wizard Council, but a botched robbery attempt lands them in jail. To clear their names, they're sent to Plynach Mountain where they encounter their first Librarian - a black-winged skeleton offering forbidden knowledge about "The Library."
