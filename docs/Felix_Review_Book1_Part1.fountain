..CREATIVE VISION

...ART STYLE: DARK FANTASY PAINTERLY

= This graphic novel adaptation uses a painterly digital art style inspired by Monstress, The Sandman, and Magic: The Gathering concept art.

**Visual Style:**

Painterly rendering with visible brushwork and textured surfaces. Rich, layered colors with dramatic chiaroscuro lighting. Moody atmospheric perspective. Intricate details in costumes, architecture, and magical effects. Expressive faces with emotional depth. Oil painting meets digital art aesthetic.

**Setting Tone:**

Epic dark fantasy with cosmic horror undertones. A world of ancient magic, imprisoned demons, and forbidden knowledge. Moments range from intimate tragedy to apocalyptic battles. The tone shifts between wonder, dread, and sorrow.

[[FELIX REVIEW: Does this art style feel right for the campaign's tone? Are there other visual references we should consider?]]

...COLOR PALETTE BY SCENE TYPE

**Adventure Scenes:** Warm golds, rich browns, forest greens - sense of journey and discovery

**Horror Scenes:** Deep purples, sickly greens, void blacks - The Library and its creatures

**Tragedy Scenes:** Desaturated blues, cold grays, muted earth tones - loss and sacrifice

**Demonic Scenes:** Burnt oranges, infernal reds, sulfur yellows - Rizzmodeus and demon encounters

**Divine Scenes:** Pale golds, ethereal whites, soft blues - Soapstone, angels, holy moments

**Political Scenes:** Rich jewel tones, deep crimsons, glass greens - Glass Citadel intrigue

**Signature Elements:**
- The Library: Black sand, void purple, skeletal white - alien and wrong
- Ring of Truth: Golden glow with white core - piercing illumination
- Clowns: Garish colors that feel unsettling against the painterly style
- Beholder Dreams: Surreal color shifts, eye motifs in reds and yellows

[[FELIX REVIEW: Do these color associations match your vision for the campaign's mood?]]

..DRAMATIS PERSONAE

...PROTAGONISTS

.EUROSTRAS
= The Haunted Pirate-Monk (Book One Protagonist)

A weathered human pirate in his forties with a haunted, distant gaze that shifts to sharp focus when "Him" takes control. Sun-darkened skin marked by old scars. Long dark hair streaked with grey, often tied back. Wears a mix of monastic robes over worn sailor's garb - a visual tension between his two identities.

**Face:** Weathered face in his forties with deep-set eyes that shift between haunted distance and monk-like serenity. Sharp cheekbones, salt-crusted stubble. Long dark hair streaked with grey, tied back with leather cord. Old scar across left temple.

**Body:** Lean and wiry sailor's build, deceptively strong. Moves with a strange duality - sometimes loose and rolling like a sailor, other times precise and centered like a trained monk.

**Clothing:** Faded grey monastic robes worn open over a sailor's weathered leather vest and loose canvas pants. Rope belt with many knots. Bare feet wrapped in cloth bindings.

**Key Items:** Golden Ring of Truth on right hand (glints with inner fire). Simple hemp rope bracelet. Sword called "Grandma's Comfort" with an ugly pattern on the blade.

**The Shared Curse:** Eurostras shares his body with a monk entity called "Him" who can take control. When Him is in control, his posture shifts to perfect stillness, eyes focused with monastic clarity, face serene rather than haunted, hands positioned in meditative mudras.

[[FELIX REVIEW: Is this accurate for Eurostras? What am I missing about the Him/Eurostras dynamic?]]

---

.ARMANDO
= The Flamboyant Warlock (All Books Protagonist)

A flamboyant human warlock with an unsettling edge beneath the showmanship. Dark hair slicked back dramatically. Sharp features with a wide smile that doesn't reach his nervous eyes. Wears theatrical crimson and black clothing befitting a circus ringmaster, with subtle infernal motifs. Deep fear of clowns lurks beneath his confident exterior.

**Face:** Sharp, angular features with high cheekbones. Slicked-back dark hair with a dramatic widow's peak. Wide showman's smile that sometimes falters. Eyes that dart nervously at any hint of clown imagery. Thin goatee trimmed to points.

**Body:** Average height, theatrical posture - always performing. Gestures dramatically when speaking. Thin but carries himself as if larger.

**Clothing:** Crimson long coat with black velvet lapels, subtle flame embroidery. Black silk shirt beneath. Dark fitted pants tucked into polished boots with slight heels. Everything slightly too theatrical, like a circus ringmaster.

**Key Items:** Several rings including a signet with Rizzmodeus's flame mark. Leather pouch of spell components. Small hidden bag of "Greenwise's finest" herb. The Eyes of Rizzmodeus - a pair of gleaming ruby-like stones.

[[FELIX REVIEW: How did Armando become Rizzmodeus's warlock? What's the source of his clown phobia?]]

---

.CORPIUM
= The Bronze Dragonborn Warrior (Books One-Two Protagonist)

A massive bronze-scaled dragonborn warrior with battle-worn scales and a pragmatic demeanor. Muscular frame carries the weight of heavy armor easily. Yellow reptilian eyes that reveal little emotion about his brother Whortheus's death. Wields the legendary axe Patricia II with brutal efficiency.

**Face:** Powerful dragonborn head with bronze scales that catch light like hammered metal. Short horns swept back. Yellow reptilian eyes, cold and calculating. Scarred snout from countless battles. No nostalgia in his expression.

**Body:** Massive and powerfully built, even for a dragonborn. Thick neck, broad shoulders. Moves with surprising grace for his size. Battle-ready stance at all times.

**Clothing:** Heavy plate armor worn over chainmail, scarred and dented from use. Leather straps and belts everywhere. Dark red cloak attached at one shoulder, frayed at edges.

**Key Items:** Patricia II - a legendary double-headed axe that gleams with ancient power. Belt with potion vials. Small dreidel on a chain (contains Gimel).

[[FELIX REVIEW: Corpium is Whortheus's brother despite one being dragonborn and one human - is this adoption, curse, or magic?]]

---

...SUPPORTING CHARACTERS

.WHORTHEUS
= The Foolish Wizard (Dies Page 5)

A scholarly human wizard, Corpium's brother, though they share no obvious resemblance despite blood relation. Thin and bookish, perpetually distracted by arcane theory. Wore robes that were always slightly singed from experiments. Died foolishly poking a bear.

**Face:** Thin, scholarly face with wire-rimmed spectacles. Wispy brown hair, often uncombed. Expression of perpetual academic distraction. Ink stains on chin from chewing quill ends.

**Body:** Thin and slightly stooped from hunching over books. Pale from spending too much time indoors. Moved with absent-minded energy.

**Clothing:** Blue wizard's robes with scorch marks and potion stains. Multiple pockets sewn in, all bulging with components. Leather sandals.

**Key Items:** Crystal orb that would later be placed in Shin. Multiple pouches of spell components. Ink-stained fingers.

[[FELIX REVIEW: What was Whortheus's relationship with Corpium really like? Does Corpium mourn him or feel relieved?]]

---

.GIMEL
= The Golden Golem (Supporting/Artifact)

A golden golem summoned from a dreidel, helpful and kind. Contains four personalities including the dangerous Nun. Can shift between forms (Gimel and Shin). Filled with golden gelt coins. Later transforms into terrifying 20-foot platinum form when absorbing Nun.

**Face:** Stylized golden face, simple and friendly in Gimel form. Geometric features suggesting kindness. Eyes of polished gold that somehow convey warmth.

**Body:** Humanoid golden construct roughly five feet tall. Proportions slightly blocky, clearly artificial. Moves with gentle mechanical precision. Golden gelt coins visible through joints.

**Clothing:** No clothing - body is polished gold. Hebrew letter carved into forehead denotes current personality.

**Key Items:** Slots and seams where coins can be deposited or withdrawn. The dreidel that summons it hangs around neck when manifested.

[[FELIX REVIEW: What are the four dreidel personalities? How was Gimel created and by whom?]]

---

.THE LIBRARIAN
= Cosmic Horror Entity (Antagonist)

Black-winged skeletal entities from The Library, offering forbidden knowledge. Not standard undead but something from outside reality. Emerge from black sand, cannot die permanently. Ancient, alien, and wrong in ways that hurt to perceive.

**Face:** Skeletal face that is subtly wrong - too many teeth, angles that don't align with reality. Empty eye sockets that somehow see. No expression but somehow conveys ancient knowing.

**Body:** Skeletal humanoid form but proportions are off - limbs too long, joints bending wrong. Moves with terrible grace. Black sand constantly trailing from bones.

**Clothing:** Tattered robes of void-black material that seems to absorb light. The fabric moves as if underwater even in still air.

**Key Items:** Great black feathered wings that fold like a cloak. Carries artifacts from The Library - scrolls, rings, strange objects. Black sand falls from every movement.

[[FELIX REVIEW: What is The Library exactly? What do the Librarians want? What is the "price" they reference?]]

..LOCATIONS

...THE SILVER TOWER
= Ancient Wizard's Sanctum (Pages 1-4)

An ancient wizard's tower of gleaming silver metal, now in dimensional ruins. The interior is a maze of broken staircases and floating platforms. Bone collections and alchemical residue hint at dark experiments. Where the Staff of Silneas was kept.

**Architecture:** Spiraling tower of silver-grey metal with arcane engravings. Interior filled with broken platforms, staircases that lead nowhere, impossible geometry suggesting dimensional damage.

**Atmosphere:** Eerie and unsettling. The air tastes of old magic and decay. Reality feels thin here, as if the tower exists between dimensions.

**Lighting:** Cold silver light filtering through cracks in reality. Occasional flickers of otherworldly blue. Shadows that don't match their sources.

**Key Features:** Bone collections on shelves, alchemical equipment, the hot staff pedestal, trap doors, dragon corpse remnants.

**DUNGEON VARIANT (Page 1):** Low stone ceilings with silver veins running through rock. Iron-barred cells, rusted with age. Magical restraints still hum with residual power. Where Eurostras awoke.

[[FELIX REVIEW: Who owned the Silver Tower? What happened to cause the dimensional damage? What was the Staff of Silneas used for?]]

---

...WATERDEEP
= The Great City (Pages 5-9)

A massive coastal city of commerce and intrigue. Towering buildings of stone and timber crowd narrow streets. The Wizard Council headquarters dominates the skyline. Mix of wealth and poverty, magic and mundane.

**Architecture:** Dense urban architecture mixing stone foundations with timber upper floors. Narrow winding streets, covered bridges between buildings. Wizard Council tower rising above all else.

**Atmosphere:** Bustling and chaotic. Street vendors, pickpockets, merchants, and mages sharing the same crowded spaces. Smell of sea salt and city life.

**Lighting:** Variable - harsh noon sun on main thoroughfares, deep shadows in alleyways. Magical lights glow from wizard quarters. Harbor light glinting off water.

**Key Features:** The Busted Bottle tavern, Wizard Council headquarters, Idelius Fashion shop, Poronin sword shop, the harbor with Khovum's ship.

[[FELIX REVIEW: What's the political structure of Waterdeep? Who is Ryan in the Wizard Council?]]

---

...PLYNACH MOUNTAIN
= The Cursed Peak (Pages 10-15)

A cursed peak where the party first encountered a Librarian. Ice-covered ruins of a cathedral crown the summit. The bowl artifact was found here, filled with milky liquid that summoned black sand.

**Architecture:** Ruined stone cathedral frozen in eternal ice. Broken walls reveal interior where altar once stood. Surrounding town reduced to rubble, some structures preserved in ice.

**Atmosphere:** Oppressive wrongness pervades. The air itself feels watched. Cold that seeps into bones despite warmth. Silence broken only by wind.

**Lighting:** Grey overcast sky above snow and ice. Interior lit by whatever light filters through broken walls. Unnatural shadows in corners that seem to move.

**Key Features:** The stone bowl on altar, milky liquid that refills magically, black sand that pools, ruins of cathedral nave, ice walls too steep to climb, golden frame fragments.

[[FELIX REVIEW: What was this cathedral before it fell? Why is the bowl here? What's the connection to The Library?]]

---

...KHOVUM'S SHIP
= Passage West (Page 16)

A sturdy merchant vessel captained by the Triton collector Khovum Pamarath. The deck holds curiosities from many lands. Crossed the sea carrying the party west, dealing with stowaways and undersea worms.

**Architecture:** Classic sailing ship with foreign design elements - Triton influences in curved lines and coral decorations. Below deck cramped but organized. Curiosity collections in captain's quarters.

**Atmosphere:** Salt spray and adventure. Working vessel with exotic touches. Creaks and groans of wood on open water. Sense of crossing into unknown lands.

**Lighting:** Bright sun on open water. Lantern light below deck. Moonlight during night watches.

**Key Features:** Captain Khovum's collection, hidden compartments, crow's nest lookout, cargo hold.

[[FELIX REVIEW: Who is Khovum Pamarath? Why is he helping the party travel west?]]

..STORY SYNOPSIS

...THE SHARED CURSE - BOOK ONE, PART ONE

= A dark fantasy tale of lost time, accidental death, moral failure, and the first whispers of cosmic horror.

.TEASER

INT. SILVER TOWER DUNGEON - NIGHT

EUROSTRAS wakes in a cell, twenty-five years missing from his memory. A golden Ring of Truth glows on his finger. Through the bars, ARMANDO and WHORTHEUS watch with concern.

This is not where our story begins - but it is where Eurostras's story resumes.

[[FELIX REVIEW: Why was Eurostras imprisoned? What happened during the 25 years?]]

---

...ACT ONE: THE AWAKENING
= Pages 1-4

.PAGE 1 - "AWAKENING" (CHAPTER 1)

INT. SILVER TOWER DUNGEON - CONTINUOUS

Eurostras wakes confused and afraid. The Ring of Truth - an artifact he doesn't remember acquiring - glows with inner fire. Armando and Whortheus are strangers to him, but apparently his allies.

EUROSTRAS
Twenty-five years... I've lost twenty-five years.

.PAGE 2 - "THE SILVER TOWER" (CHAPTER 1)

INT. SILVER TOWER - CONTINUOUS

The party ascends through dimensional chaos - broken staircases, floating platforms, reality-bending architecture. The tower feels alive with wrong magic.

The Staff of Silneas - their objective - is gone. Taken by GODRICK, who promised to return but hasn't.

ARMANDO
Godrick should have been back by now. Unless...

.PAGE 3 - "THE STAFF OF SILNEAS" (CHAPTER 1)

INT. SILVER TOWER - UPPER LEVEL

They discover evidence: Godrick has stolen the staff and fled. Dragon corpse remnants hint at the tower's dark history. CORPIUM, a bronze dragonborn warrior, joins them - Whortheus's brother despite the obvious physical impossibility.

CORPIUM
The staff is gone. Godrick betrayed us.

.PAGE 4 - "THEFT IN THE NIGHT" (CHAPTER 1)

INT. SILVER TOWER - VARIOUS

As they prepare to leave, GIMEL emerges from Corpium's dreidel - a golden golem of helpful disposition. The party descends through trap doors and bone collections.

Behind them, black sand begins to pool where the staff once rested. They don't notice.

---

...ACT TWO: CONSEQUENCES
= Pages 5-9

.PAGE 5 - "DON'T POKE THE BEAR" (CHAPTER 2)

EXT. MEADOW OUTSIDE WATERDEEP - DAY

Tragedy strikes absurdly. Whortheus, the absent-minded wizard, literally pokes a grazing bear with his staff out of "scholarly curiosity."

The bear mauls him. Eurostras casts Thunderwave to save him - but the blast kills Whortheus instead. Friendly fire.

EUROSTRAS
(staring at his hands)
No... no, no, no...

[[FELIX REVIEW: Was this how Whortheus died in the campaign? Killed by party member's spell while being mauled?]]

.PAGE 6 - "THE BROTHER" (CHAPTER 2)

EXT. CLOWN TOWN - DAY

Reeling from Whortheus's death, the party encounters CLOWN TOWN - a settlement of homeless clowns, victims of the Waterdeep Project who had their minds erased and replaced with clown personas.

A CLOWNEATER TROLL lurks nearby. In a moment of dark pragmatism (or cruelty), the party tells the troll where to find the clowns.

CLOWN RESIDENT
The Messiah will come. The prophecy says so.

ARMANDO
(to Corpium, quietly)
The troll... we could just... point it here.

[[FELIX REVIEW: Is this accurate? The party deliberately directed a monster to massacre innocent clowns?]]

.PAGE 7 - "WATERDEEP" (CHAPTER 3)

EXT. WATERDEEP - DAY

The coastal city spreads before them. Commerce and intrigue fill the streets. The Wizard Council headquarters dominates the skyline.

CORPIUM
We need answers about Godrick. The Council will know.

.PAGE 8 - "THE WIZARD COUNCIL" (CHAPTER 3)

INT. WIZARD COUNCIL HEADQUARTERS - DAY

RYAN, a wizard of the Council, reveals the truth: Godrick was never authorized to retrieve the Staff of Silneas. They were deceived.

Ryan offers them a deal - pursue Godrick, retrieve the staff, and their criminal records will be cleared. He provides tickets to a luxury cruise and gold for supplies.

RYAN
Pursue Godrick. Get the staff back. Here are tickets and coin for supplies. Simple enough?

Meanwhile, Eurostras purchases "Grandma's Comfort" - a sword with an ugly pattern like an old couch.

.PAGE 9 - "ROBBERY GONE WRONG" (CHAPTER 4)

INT. SWORD SHOP - NIGHT

Corpium and Armando eye a legendary sword worth 10,000 gold. They attempt to steal it.

They fail spectacularly.

CORPIUM
That sword though...

ARMANDO
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

[[FELIX REVIEW: What were the consequences of the failed heist?]]

---

...ACT THREE: THE MOUNTAIN
= Pages 10-15

.PAGE 10 - "A SECOND CHANCE" (CHAPTER 5)

EXT. ROAD TO PLYNACH MOUNTAIN - DAY

The party journeys toward Plynach Mountain, following rumors of Godrick's passage. The terrain grows harsh and cold.

EUROSTRAS
Ryan mentioned Silneas went mad after returning from somewhere called The Library. Plynach might have answers.

.PAGE 11 - "CLOWNING AROUND" (CHAPTER 6)

EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - DAY

The Clowneater Troll appears again - followed by traumatized clown survivors. The party's earlier moral failure returns to haunt them.

CLOWN SURVIVOR
(accusatory)
YOU told the troll where to find us.

The party must face the consequences of their choice.

.PAGE 12 - "THE CATHEDRAL RUINS" (CHAPTER 7)

EXT./INT. CATHEDRAL RUINS - DUSK

Atop Plynach Mountain, they discover cathedral ruins frozen in eternal ice. On the altar sits a stone bowl filled with milky liquid.

Something feels deeply wrong. The air itself seems to watch them.

ARMANDO
This place... it shouldn't exist.

.PAGE 13 - "THE LIBRARIAN" (CHAPTER 8)

INT. CATHEDRAL RUINS - CONTINUOUS

They interact with the bowl - and COSMIC HORROR EMERGES.

Black sand pours from the now-empty bowl, pooling and rising into a terrible form. A LIBRARIAN manifests - a black-winged skeleton with proportions that hurt to perceive, empty eye sockets that somehow see, too many teeth arranged in angles that shouldn't exist.

This is something from OUTSIDE reality.

LIBRARIAN
Knowledge seekers. The Library offers power far beyond your wizard councils... for those willing to pay the price.

[[FELIX REVIEW: What is The Library? What is the "price" the Librarian references?]]

.PAGE 14 - "FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE" (CHAPTER 8)

INT. CATHEDRAL RUINS - CONTINUOUS

The Librarian offers temptation - forbidden knowledge, power beyond mortal understanding. All they must do is accept.

The party resists. Barely.

LIBRARIAN
You will return. They always do. The Library is patient.

.PAGE 15 - "AGAINST THE IMPOSSIBLE" (CHAPTER 8)

INT. CATHEDRAL RUINS - CONTINUOUS

Corpium charges the Librarian with Patricia II. The battle is brutal and surreal - the entity fights with alien logic, moves in ways that shouldn't be possible.

They drive it back. The Librarian dissolves into black sand, leaving only the bowl behind.

But they know it isn't dead. It can't be killed.

CORPIUM
(panting)
What... what WAS that thing?

---

...ACT FOUR: DEPARTURE
= Page 16

.PAGE 16 - "RETURN TO WATERDEEP" (CHAPTER 9)

INT./EXT. WATERDEEP / KHOVUM'S SHIP - DAY

Back in Waterdeep, the party meets with Ryan again. They hide the stone bowl, not trusting anyone with knowledge of The Library.

RYAN
The evil is defeated? Good. Your sentences are cleared.

A clown shopkeeper delivers devastating news - the Clowneater massacred Clown Town after the party directed it there.

SHOPKEEPER CLOWN
A troll... it ate so many of us. Someone told it where to find us.

The party exchanges guilty looks.

At dawn, they board KHOVUM PAMARATH's ship. The Triton captain stands at the helm. The western horizon beckons.

KHOVUM
The western continent awaits. Are you prepared for what you'll find there?

EUROSTRAS
No. But we're going anyway.

The bowl is hidden in their luggage. A new chapter begins.

TO BE CONTINUED...
